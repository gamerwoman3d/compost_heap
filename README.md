//instructions

Place any great ideas for code in a .txt file in the compost heap.
Pseudocode, a lot.
Clearly label everything in the compost heap, even the moldy scraps, so that it can be found later.
Return to the compost heap when you need inspiration or need to find some way of doing a thing.

//Closing

Mostly this will be JavaScript scraps.  I also collect some python scraps, GML language scraps, HTML & CSS.

There is no license for this heap.  It's literally warm garbage.  This is not a place of honor, I do not accept any responsibility for the usage of the code in this repository as there is no explicit permission to use this warm garbage in your your own code.
